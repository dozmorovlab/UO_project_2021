### 3D genome changes in cancer

### Project background/overview 

The project involves computational analysis and interpretation of processed chromatin conformation capture data (Hi-C). The data has been generated from tumor samples obtained from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The experimental conditions include two triple-negative breast cancer PDX cells grown as primary tumors and drug-resistant clones. 

### Project goals 

Main goal is to identify changes in the 3D genome organization between drug-resistant (CR) and primary (Primary) tumors. Analyses include comparison of 1) Distance-dependent decay of interaction frequencies; 2) A/B compartments; 3) Topologically Associating Domains; 4) Chromatin loops. The outcome includes visualization and genomic coordinates of altered regions (changes in chromatin interactions).

Supplementary data include differential gene expression, CNVs, SNPs, InDels, SVs.
