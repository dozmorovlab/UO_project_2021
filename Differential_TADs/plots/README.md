`diff_tads_<parameters>.png` shows the interaction matrix with TAD domains marked in black lines. Below each matrix the TAD score is shown with local minimums indicating TAD boundaries.

`differential_boundaries.png` shows the ratio of different_boundaries:same_boundaries between the two HiC files at each chromosome.

`differential_numbers.png` shows the ratio of different_domains:same_domains between the two HiC files at each chromosome.

`tad_numbers.png` shows the number of TADs in each chromosome for each HiC file.

`tad_sizes.png` shows the average size TAD in each chromosome for each HiC file.
